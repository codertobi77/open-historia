# Map Editor

The Map Editor is a standalone OpenLayers map-authoring surface (reachable at `/?editor=1`, or embedded from a scenario's library bar) that lets a user re-own, reshape, recolour, and re-populate the world map and export it as a game-playable seed. It runs in its own React tree with its own map instance, deliberately isolated from the game's MapLibre map so the two can never disturb each other (`src/Editor/MapEditor.jsx:6`). Region *geometry* lives outside React in an OpenLayers vector source and is driven imperatively; everything else (types, cities, colours, flags, tags, metadata) lives in a document-state hook.

The editor writes a game seed in one of two tiers: **tier 1 (re-ownership)** keeps stock GADM region ids so the game renders from the shipped `regions.pmtiles`, and **tier 2 (custom geometry)** ships an exported `regions.geojson` the game renders directly. Understanding that split (`src/Editor/exportPreset.js`) is the key to the whole subsystem.

---

## 1. How the editor is reached (routes / entry points)

| Entry | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `/?editor=1` | `src/App.jsx:200` | Standalone mode. `App` reads the URL param once at render and mounts `<MapEditor />` (lazy-loaded) with no props — no `onClose`, no `onApplyToScenario`. Authoring-only; export happens via the Documents menu's download buttons. |
| Scenario "Edit map" button | `src/Game/GameUI/libraryBar.jsx:2511` (`onOpenMapEditor`) | Embedded mode. Sets `mapEditorScenario`, opens the editor, and streams the scenario's current map assets into `mapEditorSeed`. |
| Scenario Studio "Open Map Editor" | `src/Game/GameUI/ScenarioCreatorView.jsx` (`onOpenMapEditor`) | Same embedded mode as above, fired from the 4-step Scenario Creator wizard's asset step so a new scenario can be geo-authored without leaving the Studio tab. |
| Embedded `<MapEditor>` mount | `src/Game/GameUI/libraryBar.jsx:2133` | Passes `onClose`, `scenarioName`, `initialMap={mapEditorSeed}`, and `onApplyToScenario`. Presence of `onApplyToScenario` is what flips the editor into "scenario mode". |

`MapEditor`'s prop contract (`src/Editor/MapEditor.jsx:40`):

| Prop | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `onClose` | Present in embedded mode → renders the top-right **✕ Close** button. |
| `scenarioName` | Label shown in the Apply button tooltip. |
| `onApplyToScenario(seed)` | Callback that writes the built game seed into the scenario. Its presence sets `scenarioMode = true` (`:45`), which forces `seedKind="deferred"` so the default world is **not** auto-seeded underneath the scenario's own map. |
| `initialMap` | The scenario's current map (regions/owners/cities/palette/flags/tags/background/basemap), hydrated once it arrives (`:339`). |

---

## 2. File map (`src/Editor/`)

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `MapEditor.jsx` | Root component. Composes the map + toolbar + panels + inspector + bottom bar; owns cross-cutting state (open panel, paint owner, doc id, save flow, custom background, FMG). |
| `OlMap.jsx` | The OpenLayers surface. Owns the region source/layers, all editing interactions, click-selection, undo/redo, and the imperative region API exposed via `onReady`. |
| `useMapDocument.js` | Document state hook: metadata, types, features (cities), colorOverrides, flags, tags + all setters + ephemeral UI state. Region geometry is **not** here. |
| `Toolbar.jsx` | Top tool strip (single-choice tool + undo/redo/fit). |
| `BottomBar.jsx` | Status bar: counts (open managers), Layers/Reference buttons, basemap picker, map name, save-status dot, search box. |
| `SelectionInspector.jsx` | Right panel for the current region selection: name/type/country/disputed-by/colour/flag/tags + merge/copy/zoom/delete. |
| `TypeManager.jsx` | Region "type" editor (render + gameplay settings). |
| `RegionsPanel.jsx` | Searchable region list → select + zoom. |
| `FeatureManager.jsx` | City/point-feature list; bulk import from the seed. |
| `CityPopup.jsx` | Inline city editor anchored at the click. |
| `SearchBar.jsx` | Unified place search (this map's cities, regions, ~70k world places). |
| `LayersPanel.jsx` | Region / label layer visibility toggles. |
| `ReferencePanel.jsx` | Tracing-image upload/opacity/placement (session-only). |
| `BasemapPicker.jsx` | Overlay to choose a built-in ESRI basemap, a saved basemap, upload, or a community one. |
| `FlagPicker.jsx` | Overlay to choose a country flag (My flags / built-in / community). |
| `DocumentsMenu.jsx` | Top-left menu: new/open/save/export-JSON/export-for-game + author field. |
| `exportPreset.js` | `buildGameSeed` + tier detection + region normalization + verbatim-polity logic. |
| `regionImport.js` | Loads `regions-seed.geojson` into the OL source; resolves owner NAMEs from `gid0`. |
| `documentMigration.js` | Brings a legacy code-keyed document forward to name-keyed on open. |
| `documentIO.js` | REST client for `/api/mapeditor/documents` + local JSON download. |
| `customBackground.js` | Loads uploaded backgrounds (GeoJSON/KML/KMZ/SHP/GeoTIFF/PMTiles/image) into OL layers; persistence helpers. |
| `geometry.js` | Polygon boolean ops (union/difference/intersection), line split, translate. |
| `olStyle.js` | Region → OL `Style` mapping (owner colour, opacity, stroke, disputed striping). |
| `basemaps.js` | ESRI basemap presets + XYZ/preview URL builders. |
| `editorStyles.js` | Shared chrome styling constants (`panelSurface`, `inputStyle`, `ACCENT`, `pillButton`, `toolButton`). |
| `fields.jsx` | Form-field primitives (`Row`, `TextField`, `NumberField`, `ColorField`, `Toggle`, `SelectField`, `TagField`) + hex/rgb helpers. |
| `fmg/FmgPanel.jsx`, `fmg/fmgDriver.js`, `fmg/fmgImport.js` | Fantasy Map Generator drawer, headless Azgaar runner, result→editor-seed converter. |
| `flagImage.js`, `citiesImport.js` | Flag downscaling; seed-city import + search. |

---

## 3. Architecture & data flow

Two stores, split by weight (`src/Editor/useMapDocument.js:6`):

- **Document state** (React, in `useMapDocument`) — metadata, region `types`, point `features` (cities), `colorOverrides`, `flags`, `tags`. Cheap, serialisable, the source of truth for everything except geometry.
- **Region geometry** (OpenLayers `VectorSource`, in `OlMap`) — ~3,662 filled/stroked polygons, far too heavy for React state. Materialised into the document only on **save/export** via `api.serializeRegions()`.

`MapEditor` receives the imperative region API through `OlMap`'s `onReady={setApi}` callback (`src/Editor/MapEditor.jsx:453`). Panels never touch the map directly; they call `api.*` methods, which mutate OL features and call `layer.changed()` to restyle. Region mutations fire `onRegionsChanged` → `setSaveStatus("dirty")` → debounced autosave.

```
DocumentsMenu / BottomBar ─┐
SelectionInspector ────────┤   props (colors, types, selection…)
TypeManager / Features … ──┼──► MapEditor ──► OlMap  ──► OL VectorSource (geometry)
                           │        │  ▲            (api.* imperative calls)
                           └────────┘  └── onReady(api), onSelectionChange, onRegionsChanged
```

---

## 4. Document model (`useMapDocument.js`)

`createDocument()` (`:59`) shape:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string \| null | Document id (assigned by the catalog store on first save); null until first save. |
| `version` | number | Document schema version (1). |
| `metadata.name` | string | Map name. |
| `metadata.kind` | `"import-world"` \| `"blank"` | Drives seeding + tier detection. |
| `metadata.author` | string | Shown as "Made by …" credit. |
| `metadata.basemap` | string | Built-in basemap id (default `"ocean"`). |
| `metadata.customBackground` | object \| null | Persisted uploaded background (image `dataUrl`+aspect, or vector `geojson`). |
| `metadata.simulationRules`, `startingTimelineText`, `startDate`, `gameDate` | string | Carried into the game seed. |
| `types` | Type[] | Region types (see §11). Seeded with `DEFAULT_TYPES` (Land, Coastal). |
| `features` | Feature[] | Point features / cities (see §12). |
| `ownerSchema` | number | `OWNER_SCHEMA` marker — says "owners are NAMEs, not codes". Critical: a doc without it re-migrates every open. |
| `colorOverrides` | `{ [countryName]: [r,g,b] }` | The map-maker's own colour choices. |
| `flags` | `{ [countryName]: dataURL }` | Author-set flags (downscaled PNG data URLs). |
| `tags` | `{ [countryName]: string[] }` | Starting ideology/alignment tags. |

**Colours are keyed by country NAME, not GADM code** — this is true of `colorOverrides`, `flags`, `tags`, and region `owner` alike. See §10.

The hook exposes a derived `colors` = `{ ...fetchedPalette, ...colorOverrides }` (`:194`) so an edited colour paints immediately exactly as it will in-game; `basePalette` is the fetched palette alone (`/assets/colors.json`, `:110`) so the UI can offer a **Reset** when an override exists. `mergeColors(extra)` layers a scenario's own polity colours on top.

Setters (all set `saveStatus="dirty"`):

| Setter | Guard |
|---|---|
| `setColorOverride(country, rgb)` | `null` rgb deletes the key. |
| `setFlag(country, dataUrl)` | `null` deletes. Value is an already-downscaled PNG data URL. |
| `setTags(country, list)` | Uses `.length` (not truthiness) so an empty `[]` deletes rather than persisting `[]` for every touched country (`:160`). |
| `setTypes`, `setFeatures` | Accept updater fn or value. |
| `patchMetadata` / `setBasemap` / `setName` / `setAuthor` | Metadata patches. |

`saveStatus` ∈ `saved | dirty | saving | error`; `counts` = `{ regions, features, types }`.

---

## 5. The OpenLayers surface (`OlMap.jsx`)

Created once in a `[]`-dep effect and driven through refs so it survives React re-renders (`:232`). Props flow in through refs (`typesByIdRef`, `colorsRef`, `selectedIdsRef`, `activeToolRef`, `paintOwnerRef`, …) so the map stays valid without recreating.

### Layers (z-index ladder)

| Layer | Type | zIndex | Source / notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Base basemap | `TileLayer` (XYZ ESRI / OSM) | 0 | Swapped by `basemap` prop; **not created** while a custom image/vector background is active (`:1019`). |
| Custom background | vector/raster `VectorLayer`/`WebGLTileLayer`/`TileLayer`, or image `ImageLayer`(`ImageStatic`) | 5 | Uploaded map; image is stretched across the whole world extent (`WORLD_EXTENT_3857`). |
| Regions | `VectorImageLayer` | 10 | `regionSource`, `imageRatio:2`, `wrapX:false`; style = `makeRegionStyle(...)`. |
| Region labels | `VectorLayer` (declutter) | 20 | Same source; `minZoom:4`; label per named region unless `type.includedInLabels === false`. |
| Cities / points | `VectorLayer` (declutter) | 30 | `pointSource`; zoom+prominence gated so ~70k cities never all render. |
| Reference image | `ImageLayer` | 40 | Tracing aid (session only). |
| Reference frame | `VectorLayer` | 41 | Dashed outline + corner handles while the Reference panel is open. |

**Two performance-critical choices** (documented at `:232` and `:250`): `wrapX:false` on the source/layers (stops OL redrawing the world sideways *and* fixes ±180° editing), and `VectorImageLayer` for regions (rasterise-once/re-blit instead of re-rasterising thousands of paths per frame). Serialisation uses `writeFeaturesObject` (not `JSON.parse(writeFeatures(...))`) to avoid building an ~83MB string on every 2s autosave (`:785`).

### Click handling (`map.on("singleclick")`, `:372`)

Only these tools consume a click: `select`, `delete`, `paint`, `feature`, `dissolve`. `map.forEachFeatureAtPixel` hit-tests the region layer (tolerance 2). Ctrl/Cmd/Shift = additive selection. Double-click with Select selects the **whole country** (all regions sharing the owner) and returns `false` to suppress OL's DoubleClickZoom (`:480`).

### The imperative region API (returned by `onReady`, `:601`)

This is the surface every panel drives. Each mutating call pushes an undo/redo command onto an 80-entry stack (`pushCmd`, `:225`) and calls `notifyRegions()` (→ dirty).

| Method | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `map`, `regionSource`, `regionLayer`, `labelLayer` | Raw OL handles. |
| `fitToData()` | Fit view to all regions. |
| `zoomToRegion(id)` / `zoomToSelection(ids)` | Fit to one/many. |
| `setRegionAttrs(ids, patch)` | Patch `owner` / `typeId` / `name` / `claimants` on many regions at once, undoably. The workhorse behind the inspector. |
| `deleteRegions(ids)` | Remove regions. |
| `mergeRegions(ids)` | Union ≥2 regions into the first; others removed. Uses `unionGeoms` (`geometry.js`). |
| `copyRegions(ids)` | Duplicate with a view-scaled offset; new ids, `" copy"` name, carries typeId/owner/gid0/claimants. |
| `getRegionSummary(id)` | `{ id, name, owner, typeId, country, claimants }`. |
| `listOwners()` | Sorted unique owner names — backs the Country field's suggestions so re-owning offers existing names (avoids near-miss forks). |
| `queryRegions(text, limit=200)` | Search id/name/owner. |
| `countByType()` | Region count per typeId (Type Manager usage). |
| `setLayerVisibility(key, visible)` | `regions` \| `labels` \| `features`. |
| `locateFeature(coord)` | Fly to a lon/lat. |
| `serializeRegions()` | Region geometry → GeoJSON FC (EPSG:4326, 5 decimals). Used on save/export. |
| `loadRegions(fc)` | Replace the source from a FeatureCollection (ids pulled from `properties.id`). |
| `reseedWorld()` | Load the stock world seed fresh. |
| `reseedWorldWithOwners(overrides)` | Load stock world, then stamp `{regionId: ownerName}` overrides — how a tier-1 scenario opens. |
| `undo()` / `redo()` | Drive the command stack. |
| `restyle()` | Force `layer.changed()`. |

Keyboard: **Ctrl/⌘+Z** undo, **Ctrl/⌘+Shift+Z / Ctrl+Y** redo, **Delete/Backspace** removes the selection — all suppressed while typing in an input (`:545`).

---

## 6. Tools (`Toolbar.jsx` + `OlMap.jsx` interaction effect)

Single-choice; the active tool mounts/unmounts OL interactions in the `[activeTool]` effect (`src/Editor/OlMap.jsx:854`).

| Tool | id | Interaction / behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| Select | `select` | Click = select region; Ctrl/Shift = additive; double-click = whole country. |
| Lasso select | `lasso` | Freehand `Draw` polygon; on `drawend` selects every region whose interior point falls inside (`selectWithinPolygon`, `:868`). |
| Pan | `pan` | No interaction added; default map drag. |
| Draw region | `draw` | `Draw` (Polygon, `trace:true`, `traceSource:source`) + `Snap`. Clicking a border traces along it. **On `drawend` the new polygon is carved OUT of every region it overlaps** (`subtractFrom`, R-tree extent query for candidates) so no ground is owned twice; carved neighbours get `edited:true` (`:889`). Inside → hole; across an edge → bite; fully over → deletes the underlying region. |
| Edit vertices | `modify` | `Modify` + `Snap`. On `modifyend` sets `edited:true` on dragged features (`:963`). |
| Move | `move` | `Translate` on the region layer. |
| Delete | `delete` | Click removes a region (a city hit under the cursor wins). |
| Delete border (dissolve) | `dissolve` | Click a region; probes neighbouring pixels for the region across the nearest border and unions the two into one (`:428`). |
| Paint owner | `paint` | Click stamps the current **Paint owner** value (a country NAME, trimmed, never case-folded) onto the clicked region (`:394`). A floating owner input + swatch appears at the top (`MapEditor.jsx:553`). |
| City tool | `feature` | Click empty map → `onFeatureCreate` (drops a city + opens `CityPopup`); click a city → `onFeatureEdit`. Carries the underlying region's owner/regionId (`:410`). |
| Undo / Redo / Fit | — | Toolbar buttons wired to `api.undo/redo/fitToData`. |

The **`edited` flag** is the linchpin of tier-2 correctness: a reshaped GADM region's true geometry now lives in the exported GeoJSON while the stock tiles still hold its original shape. The exporter carries `edited:true` into the game so `Nations.jsx` renders it from the GeoJSON and excludes it from the stock-tile fill (otherwise the original shape repaints on top, darker — the "edited-region shade" bug).

---

## 7. Editing a region's attributes (`SelectionInspector.jsx`)

Shown whenever ≥1 region is selected. Writes go straight through `api.setRegionAttrs(selection, patch)` (`:57`), which live-restyles. Fields:

| Field | Applies | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Name** (single only) | `{ name }` | The region label. |
| **Type** | `{ typeId }` | `— mixed —` shown when a multi-selection disagrees. |
| **Country** (owner) | `{ owner: v.trim() \| null }` | Free-text country NAME, backed by a `<datalist>` of existing owners (`listOwners()`). **Typing a name that doesn't exist creates that country** — there is no separate "add country" step. Field keeps raw text but applies trimmed (`:118`). No case-folding. |
| **Disputed by** (claimants) | `{ claimants }` | `TagField` of country names. Any claimant makes the region render **striped** (owner colour + each claimant's), here and in-game. |
| **Colour** | `setColorOverride(owner, rgb)` | Only shown with an owner. **Reset** appears when an override exists (`colorOverrides[owner]`). |
| **Flag** | opens `FlagPicker` via `onOpenFlagPicker(owner)` | Renders current flag thumbnail. |
| **Tags** | `setTags(owner, next)` | `TagField` with `TAG_SUGGESTIONS`; free vocabulary. |

Footer buttons: **Clear country** (`owner:null`), **Merge** (≥2), **Copy**, **Zoom**, **Delete**.

Note the owner/colour/flag/tag edits are keyed to the *country name*, so editing one region's colour recolours the whole country everywhere.

---

## 8. Region types (`TypeManager.jsx`)

A "type" carries render + gameplay settings and is referenced by each region's `typeId`. Seeded with `DEFAULT_TYPES` = Land + Coastal (`useMapDocument.js:18`). Editing a type live-restyles (OlMap restyles on the `types` prop). Type schema:

| Field | Used by | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id`, `name` | — | Identity. |
| `opacity` | `olStyle.js` | Fill alpha for **owned** regions. |
| `unownedOpacity` | `olStyle.js` | Fill alpha for unowned. |
| `zIndex` | `olStyle.js` | Draw order. |
| `strokeWidth`, `strokeColor`, `strokeOpacity` | `olStyle.js` | Border. |
| `overrideColor` | `olStyle.js` | Force a fixed fill instead of the owner colour (`null` = off). |
| `pathfindingSpeed`, `interactable`, `passable`, `showToDefaultPrompt` | game | Gameplay flags. |
| `includedInLabels` | `OlMap` label layer | `false` suppresses the region label. |
| `zoomSettings: [{minZoom,maxZoom}]` | `pickZoomBand` (`olStyle.js:88`) | Hides the type outside the zoom band. |

At least one type must always exist (delete is disabled at length 1).

---

## 9. Cities / point features

Point features (mostly cities) live in `doc.features`. Feature schema (`citiesImport.js:31`, `MapEditor.jsx` create paths):

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | `newId("feat")`. |
| `name` | City name. |
| `type` | `"Coordinate"`. |
| `symbol` | `square` \| `circle` \| `triangle` \| `star`. |
| `coord` | `[lon, lat]`. |
| `country`, `owner`, `regionId` | Context of where it was dropped. |
| `population` | Drives the prominence tier. |
| `tags` | e.g. `["city"]`, `["city","capital"]`. |

**Editing paths:**
- **City tool + `CityPopup`** (`CityPopup.jsx`) — inline editor at the click. Name, **Size** select (Town 20k / City 250k / Major 1.5M — maps to population) and a **★ Capital** checkbox (toggles the `capital` tag). Enter/Esc closes.
- **Feature Manager** (`FeatureManager.jsx`) — searchable list; per-feature name/symbol/tags, locate, delete, **Delete All**, and **Import all cities** / **Major only** which pull from `public/assets/cities-seed.json` (~70k, deduped by `name|coord`).
- **Search bar** (`SearchBar.jsx`) — unified search over this map's cities, its regions, and the ~70k world place index; world results get a **＋ Add** button to drop them as a city.

Prominence tier (`exportPreset.js:100`, `cityTier`): `capital`→4, ≥1M→3, ≥100k→2, else 1. This gates when a city label appears in-game (`Cities.jsx`).

---

## 10. Owner-name handling (names, not codes)

This is the single most important invariant and the source of most historical bugs.

**A region's `owner` is the owning country's DISPLAY NAME** ("Russia", "Roman Empire"), not a GADM code. So are the keys of `colorOverrides`, `flags`, and `tags`. The region **id** stays a GADM identifier (`DEU.2_1`) or an editor id (`reg_…`) and is the thing tier detection tests — it does **not** move with owner renames (`isGid1`, `exportPreset.js:21`).

Where names come from and stay clean:

1. **Seed load** (`regionImport.js:68`) — each stock region's owner is resolved from its `gid0` through `COUNTRY_NAMES` (`gid0 → name`), **not** the seed's own `country` string (which disagrees: "México" vs "Mexico", truncated names). The seed's `country` is unset after resolution so a second copy can't drift.
2. **Paint / inspector** — owner text is trimmed but **never case-folded** (`OlMap.jsx:401`, `SelectionInspector.jsx:118`); a trailing space would fork a duplicate polity.
3. **Legacy documents** — `migrateDocumentOwners` (§23) rekeys code→name on open.

**Export polity logic** (`exportPreset.js:184`): `STOCK_COUNTRY_NAMES = new Set(Object.values(COUNTRY_NAMES))`. For each owner:
- If the stock world already knows the name (`STOCK_COUNTRY_NAMES.has(owner)`) → no polity entry needed; the game names/colours/flags it itself.
- Otherwise → emit a `polityOverrides[owner]` entry so the game and the model learn the country exists at all.
- **Verbatim flag**: if the invented name *collides with a real GADM code* (`COUNTRY_NAMES[owner]` truthy — e.g. a map-maker literally names a country `"USA"`), the entry gets `verbatim: true` so `resolveOwnerName` (`src/runtime/shared/ownerMigration.js`) keeps it literal instead of canonicalising `"USA" → "United States"`. A plain invented name ("Freedonia") needs no flag — it already resolves to itself.

Colours priority in the seed (`:181`): `colorOverrides[owner]` (a human's chosen colour, wins) → `palette[owner]` → `codeToColor(owner)` (deterministic hash, mirrors the game's fallback).

---

## 11. Region colours & disputed striping (`olStyle.js`)

One style function for all regions, memoised per `typeId|owner|selected|zoomBand|claimants` (`makeRegionStyle`, `:102`). Fill = `type.overrideColor` → owner colour (`palette[owner] || codeToColor(owner)`) → neutral gray. Alpha switches on owned vs unowned; a selected region gets +0.22 alpha, an accent stroke, and zIndex 999. The palette-swap guard clears the cache when the palette identity changes (so a scenario's `colors.json` arriving late doesn't leave stale fills).

**Disputed regions** with claimants get a diagonally striped `CanvasPattern` (`makeStripePattern`, `:48`): administrator colour first, then each deduped claimant, `(x+y) mod period` bands. Requires ≥2 distinct colours.

---

## 12. Flags (`FlagPicker.jsx`)

A full-screen overlay (community-hub purple, not editor blue) mounted at `MapEditor`'s root — **not** inside the inspector, because the panel's `backdrop-filter` makes a containing block that would trap a `position:fixed` overlay (`FlagPicker.jsx:31`). Opened via `flagPickerFor` state, wired to `d.setFlag(flagPickerFor, value)`.

Tabs:
- **In the game** — *Already on this map* (flags already placed → reuse), *My flags* (saved to the library, reusable across maps), and *Built-in flags* (`listBuiltInFlags()`).
- **Community** — fetched via the hub proxy; a single flag installs as a data URL, a scenario **flag pack** (`fromScenario`) installs wholesale into My flags (dedup by content hash).

Upload (`fileToFlagDataUrl`, `FLAG_ACCEPT`) saves to the library first, then applies. **Remove** re-selects the standard code-derived flag (`pick(null)`). Values stored in `doc.flags` are downscaled PNG data URLs.

---

## 13. Basemaps & custom backgrounds

### Built-in basemaps (`basemaps.js`)
Ten token-free ESRI/ArcGIS presets (`EDITOR_BASEMAPS`): `ocean` (default), `imagery`, `streets`, `topo`, `terrain`, `shaded`, `natgeo`, `physical`, `light-gray`, `dark-gray`. XYZ template via `esriXyzUrl(service)`; picker previews use the z0 whole-world tile (`esriPreviewUrl`).

### Custom backgrounds (`customBackground.js`, `BasemapPicker.jsx`)
Uploaded via the **Basemap: …** button (bottom bar) → `BasemapPicker` overlay ("Built-in maps" / "Your basemaps" / Community). `loadBackgroundFile` dispatches by extension (`BACKGROUND_ACCEPT`):

| Format | Result kind | Persisted? |
|---|---|---|
| `.geojson`/`.json` | `vector` (outline, or biome fill if features carry `fill`) | yes (GeoJSON) |
| `.kml` / `.kmz` | `vector` | yes |
| `.shp` / `.zip` | `vector` (via `shpjs`, dynamic import) | yes |
| `.tif`/`.tiff` (GeoTIFF) | `raster` (WebGL) | **no** (session reference only) |
| `.pmtiles` | `raster` | **no** |
| `.png`/`.jpg`/`.svg` | `image` (data URL, stretched across the world) | yes |

Heavy parsers (`shpjs`, `jszip`) are dynamically imported so they only load on demand. Persistable backgrounds (`vector`/`image`) are saved into `doc.metadata.customBackground` and rebuilt on open via `rebuildPersistedBackground(saved, {persisted})` — the `persisted` flag stops a restored background from re-dirtying the doc on load. In the game, a custom background **replaces Earth** and forces `world.customRegions` on (so the stock political overlay is hidden).

---

## 14. Reference image / tracing aid (`ReferencePanel.jsx` + OlMap ref-image effects)

A semi-transparent image above the region fills (z40) that a map-maker aligns a source map to and traces over. Upload → placed at 60% of the view width; **Opacity**, **Visible**, **Center on view**, **Remove**. While the Reference panel is open, a dashed frame with corner handles appears (z41) — drag inside to move, drag a corner to resize (free aspect). **Session-only**: it lives entirely in component state (`refImage`) and a ref (`refImageExtentRef`), never saved to the document and never exported (`MapEditor.jsx:63`, `OlMap.jsx:1089`).

---

## 15. Fantasy Map Generator (`fmg/`)

A right-edge **🗺 GENERATE** drawer (`FmgPanel.jsx`) with inputs: seed, landmass template (`continents`/`archipelago`/`pangea`/…), detail (points), countries, cultures, cities, and "regions from provinces". **Generate** calls `generateFromFmg` (`MapEditor.jsx:123`), which runs Azgaar's Fantasy Map Generator headlessly (`fmgDriver.js`, vendored FMG at `/fmg`) and converts the result via `fmgToEditorSeed`. The import: `api.loadRegions(seed.regions)`, cities → `doc.features`, `mergeColors(seed.colors)`, and the biome basemap saved as a vector custom background (also added to "Your basemaps"). Marks the doc dirty and fits the view.

---

## 16. Geometry operations (`geometry.js`)

Boolean ops run directly on OL geometries in EPSG:3857 via `polygon-clipping` (no reprojection round-trip):

| Fn | Use |
|---|---|
| `unionGeoms(geoms)` | Merge / dissolve. |
| `subtractFrom(target, cutter)` | Draw-carve (returns survivor, `null` if swallowed whole, or unchanged if disjoint). Drawing inside leaves a hole (interior ring). |
| `overlaps(a, b)` | Cheap intersection guard so draw only rewrites genuinely-overlapping neighbours. |
| `splitByLine(olGeom, line)` | Buffer a drawn line into a thin cutter, subtract, group fragments onto the two sides, union each → `[{geom,area},…]` largest first. |
| `translatedClone(g, dx, dy)` | Copy/paste offset. |

## 17. Persistence (`documentIO.js`, save flow)

The `/api/mapeditor/documents` REST endpoints (`GET` list, `GET /:id`, `POST` create, `PUT /:id` update, `DELETE /:id`) are answered on the web build by the fetch-interceptor, which routes them to `src/runtime/web/editorStore.js` persisting to IndexedDB — there is no server process. `downloadJson` writes a local `.json`.

`buildPayload()` (`MapEditor.jsx:180`) is a **strict whitelist** — `name, metadata, types, features, colorOverrides, flags, tags, ownerSchema, regions`. **Anything not named here is silently dropped on save**; a new document field appears to work until the first reload. `regions` = `api.serializeRegions()`.

Save robustness:
- **Debounced autosave** every 2s while `dirty`, keyed on `d.doc` (a fresh object per change) rather than a hand-listed field set — the old field list went stale and silently lost colour/flag/tag edits (`:289`).
- **`beforeunload`** guard while `dirty`/`saving` (`:304`).
- **`visibilitychange`/`pagehide` flush** via refs (avoids stale-closure loss on mobile suspend) (`:320`).
- **Close** tries to save first and only prompts if the save fails (`:508`).

## 18. Exporting to a game seed (`exportPreset.js` → `buildGameSeed`)

`buildGameSeed(doc, regionsFC, palette, {playerCountry})` (`:156`) is called for **Export for game** (download) and **Apply & Play**. Steps:

1. Walk regions → build `regionOwnershipOverrides = {regionId: ownerName}`, collect owners, count custom-id regions.
2. `detectCustomGeometry(regionsFC, kind)` (`:87`) → **tier 2** if `kind==="blank"`, or any region has a non-GADM id (`reg_…`), `mergedFrom`, or `edited`. Otherwise **tier 1**.
3. `normalizeRegionsForGame` (`:43`) → rebuild an FC whose **properties** (MapLibre reads `["get","id"]`) carry `id, owner, gid0, name, typeId`, plus `claimants` and `edited` when present. Feature id is kept in properties only (a non-integer top-level id spams warnings).
4. Build `colors`, `polityOverrides` (§10), cities (`buildCitiesForGame`), and background descriptor + heavy payload (`buildBackgroundForGame`).

### Seed shape (return value)

| Key | Contents |
|---|---|
| `name`, `kind`, `author`, `credit` | Identity. |
| `hasCustomGeometry` | Tier flag. |
| `stats` | `{ ownedRegions, owners, customGeometry }`. |
| `world.regionOwnershipOverrides` | `{regionId: ownerName}`. |
| `world.polityOverrides` | `{name:{name,aliases:[],color:'#hex',note:'',verbatim?}}`. |
| `world.customRegions` | `hasCustomGeometry \|\| Boolean(background)`. |
| `world.background` / `world.basemap` | Light background descriptor / chosen ESRI basemap id. |
| `world.customCities` | `true` if authored cities exist or geometry is custom. |
| `world.author`, `mapCredit`, `simulationRules`, `startingTimelineText` | Metadata. |
| `colors` | `{ ...palette, ...colors, ...overrides }` — full palette so tier-1 keeps every stock country's colour. |
| `game` | `{ country, startDate, gameDate }`. |
| `flags` / `tags` | The doc's, or **`null`** when empty (null means "don't touch the scenario's file"). |
| `regions` | Normalized game-ready FC (uploaded only when tier 2). |
| `cities` | Authored `cities.geojson`. |
| `backgroundData` | Heavy `{dataUrl}` / `{geojson}`, or `null`. |

**Tier 1 vs tier 2 recap:** tier 1 = re-ownership only → the game renders shapes from `regions.pmtiles` and needs just `world.json` (`regionOwnershipOverrides`+`polityOverrides`) + `colors.json` (like the bundled WWII/Medieval presets). Tier 2 = new/split/merged/reshaped geometry → the exported `regions.geojson` carries the shapes and `world.customRegions` tells the game to render from the GeoJSON layer (`src/Game/Map/Nations.jsx`).

## 19. How edits reach the game — Apply & Play (`libraryBar.jsx` `applyMapToScenario`)

In embedded mode, **▶ Apply & Play** calls `onApplyToScenario(seed)` (`MapEditor.jsx:198`), which runs `applyMapToScenario(scenario, seed)` (`libraryBar.jsx:1754`). It writes `world`/`game` via `saveScenario` (merging over the current world; sets `ownerCodes` for the start-country picker, `customRegions:true`) then uploads each seed piece as a scenario asset:

| Seed field | Scenario asset | Empty behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `colors` | `colors` | always written |
| `flags` | `flags` | `clearScenarioAsset` when null |
| `tags` | `tags` | `clearScenarioAsset` when null |
| `regions` | `regionsGeojson` | always written |
| `cities` | `citiesGeojson` | always written |
| `backgroundData` | `backgroundData` | `clearScenarioAsset` when null |

The `null`-means-clear contract is why hydration (§20) must reload the scenario's existing flags/tags/background — otherwise a round-trip that "loaded none" would clear the author's work. Finally it creates + activates a fresh game so the running map reflects the edit.

---

## 20. Opening a scenario's current map (hydration)

When the editor opens from a scenario, `onOpenMapEditor` (`libraryBar.jsx:2511`) fetches the scenario's `regionsGeojson`, `citiesGeojson`, `colors`, `flags`, `tags`, and (if any) `backgroundData`, assembling `mapEditorSeed` = `{ name, author, ownershipOverrides, regions, cities, colors, flags, tags, background, basemap }`. `MapEditor`'s hydrate effect (`:339`, runs once) builds the base document, restores flags/tags/background/basemap, maps cities → features, then:
- `api.loadRegions(initialMap.regions)` if the scenario has custom geometry, **else** `api.reseedWorldWithOwners(initialMap.ownershipOverrides)` (stock world + overrides = its tier-1 map).

`scenarioMode` forces `seedKind="deferred"` so `OlMap` doesn't auto-seed the default world under the scenario's map.

---

## 21. Document migration (`documentMigration.js`)

`migrateDocumentOwners(doc)` runs on every **open** (`MapEditor.openDoc`, `:245`). A doc is legacy while `ownerSchema < OWNER_SCHEMA`. Migration rekeys `colorOverrides`/`flags`/`tags` and every region `owner` from GADM code → name via `COUNTRY_NAMES` (`rekeyOwnerMap`), strips region `country`, and stamps `ownerSchema = OWNER_SCHEMA`. It lives in the editor (not the store) because a document is the one path where legacy owners can enter a scenario already wearing a "migrated" badge (an applied doc inherits the target's `ownerSchema`, so the store's migration would never run). No-op once migrated — safe to call every open.

---

## 22. Standalone editor repo & mirroring note

The editor was split into a standalone repo (`Open-Historia/open-historia-map-editor`), but the game still **embeds its own copy** under `src/Editor/`. Edits to editor source generally need mirroring to both. Copying whole files wholesale between the two drifts app-only wiring (e.g. the game-embed props); prefer targeted edits. The FMG generator is vendored at `/fmg` (Azgaar v1.109).

---

## 23. Gotchas & invariants (quick reference)

- **Owner is a NAME, everywhere.** Never re-introduce a code path or case-fold owner text (`OlMap.jsx:401`, `SelectionInspector.jsx:118`).
- **`buildPayload` is a whitelist** — a new doc field that isn't listed silently fails to persist (`MapEditor.jsx:180`).
- **`edited`/`mergedFrom`/non-GADM id ⇒ tier 2.** These are the only signals that ship geometry (`exportPreset.js:87`).
- **`flags`/`tags`/`background` null = "clear the scenario asset."** Always re-hydrate them on open so a round-trip is a no-op (`MapEditor.jsx:352`, `libraryBar.jsx:2525`).
- **`wrapX:false` + `VectorImageLayer`** are correctness+performance load-bearing; don't revert (`OlMap.jsx:232`,`:250`).
- **Reference image is session-only** — never let it into saves or exports (`MapEditor.jsx:63`).
- **Render-path changes must be verified by booting the app** — build+grep proves nothing (see the runtime-verification memory).
- Region geometry is verified in-app; a headless WebGL context can't pixel-check the game map.
